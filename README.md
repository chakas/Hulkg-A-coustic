Showcase of different photos using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery.
Here I used many css effects, also used jQuery for smooth scrolling.The site is also responsive. Tried to make it as my personal photography site,
that's why I used footer where I put information about the photography company.

TODO
1. to add effect on the entry page on the logo button after 12 second to start glitch effect
   background or company name;


2. the third letter in the nav bar  to make small
3.  To supplement the icon and the square with a photo which overlays the background photo
